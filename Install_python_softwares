INSTALL poppler
https://gist.github.com/Dayjo/618794d4ff37bb82ddfb02c63b450a81

INSTALL tranning data of languages
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki  (UBUNTU 18.04)


First install all these prerequisites for compiling:

sudo apt install g++ autoconf libfontconfig1-dev pkg-config libjpeg-dev libopenjpeg-dev gnome-common libglib2.0-dev gtk-doc-tools libyelp-dev yelp-tools gobject-introspection libsecret-1-dev libnautilus-extension-dev

First download the encoding files (no need to compile these) to the current working directory

wget https://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-data-0.4.7.tar.gz

Extract (it does untar cleanly):

tar -xf poppler-data-0.4.7.tar.gz

Enter the directory

cd poppler-data-0.4.7

And magically send the files to the right locations in /usr/share with:

sudo make install

Now go back up one level

cd ..

Download & extract the main package:

wget https://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-0.48.0.tar.xz
tar -xf poppler-0.48.0.tar.xz
cd poppler-0.48.0

Now run the configure file like this:

./configure

Here you will get errors if I missed anything from my list of dependencies above. The errors might be illuminating eg 'thing-you-need not found' in which case you can try sudo apt install thing-you-need and try again. If that doesn't work, try searching online for the error message.

If it exits without errors you can run:

make

Which will take a while. When it's done, you can use

sudo make install

If you use sudo make install you can still uninstall at any time by entering the source directory (so keep it!) and typing sudo make uninstall

Symlink the binaries to the /usr/bin directory

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftotext /usr/bin/pdftotext
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftoppm /usr/bin/pdftoppm
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libpoppler.so.64 /usr/lib/libpoppler.so.64
